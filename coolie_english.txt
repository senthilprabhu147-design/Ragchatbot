Coolie (2025) – Storyline

Devaraj “Deva” runs a boarding house and looks after his late friend Rajasekhar’s daughter, Preethi. Rajasekhar’s sudden death is blamed on a heart attack, but Deva suspects foul play.

Meanwhile, a criminal syndicate led by Simon and his men Dayalan (Dayal) and Kalyani smuggle gold and luxury goods. They secretly kill people and use a special cremation-chair device to dispose of bodies. Dayal even murders an undercover policeman disguised as a coolie. Preethi, who knows how this device works, becomes a target.

Deva steps in to protect her and uncovers the gang’s operations. As the fight deepens, shocking truths come out: Kalyani is not who she seems, Preethi is actually Deva’s daughter, and Simon’s past is tied to Deva’s own history. Years ago, Deva was a union leader in Mandwa, leading coolies against exploitation. Simon is the son of Deva’s old enemy Xavier, linking the present conflict to Deva’s past battles.

The story races toward a showdown where Deva takes on Simon and Dayal, rescues Preethi, and destroys the syndicate. Simon is killed, Dayal is captured, and the workers regain dignity. In the end, Deva and Preethi reconcile emotionally, though her full awareness of his identity is left incomplete. The movie closes with a hint of a larger global network, led by a mysterious figure named Daaha, suggesting more to come.
